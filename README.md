# Bengali-Lexical-Analyzer

This is an open-source project, which personally developed for parsing code-structures written in Bangla. It is implemented using pure Python programming language, without the help of any existing library or framework. It is capable of tokenization, symbol-table construction, and syntax-level error detection.
